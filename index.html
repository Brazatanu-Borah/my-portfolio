	<h1>Hello, my name is Brazatanu Borah</h1>

	<h2>..and I'm a beginning HTML and CSS coder from India</h2>
	
	<p>Currently, I do photo editing and designing work for clients on freelance websites as a living.</p>
	
	<p>I had dabbled in HTML and CSS back sometime in 2019 and 2020, but was kind of like a hobby thing. But now, I am a starting to <u>learn to code</u> professionally and practicing <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>.</p>

	<p>Once I am comfortable with HTML And CSS, I'll start building small projects with <strong>Bootstrap</strong></p>

	<p>Also.. I would like to learn some real programming languages like JavaScript and Python in the future.</p>

	<h4>I have completed the basics of HTML till now. I will be moving on to CSS. <em><mark>I'll be uploading projects as I learn new concepts in html, css and general web development</mark></em>.</h4>
